Welcome to MLflavors` Documentation
===================================
This package adds MLflow support for some popular ML frameworks currently
not considered for inclusion as MLflow built-in flavors. The MLflow interface
for the supported frameworks follows the design of built-in flavors.

Using this package you can save your trained model as an MLflow artifact and
serve the model for batch and real-time inference to an endpoint in the cloud.
