mlflow-flavors Documentation
===================================
This package adds MLflow support for some popular machine learning frameworks currently not available as MLflow built-in flavors.
The MLflow interface for the supported frameworks follows the design of built-in flavors.

Using this package you can save your model as an MLflow artifact, load your model from MLflow for batch inference,
or serve your model for real-time inference to a REST API endpoint.
